            Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for
            previewing layouts and visual mockups.
            <br><br>
            From its medieval origins to the digital era, learn everything there is to know about the ubiquitous lorem
            ipsum passage.
            <br><br>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            <br><br>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
            of Lorem Ipsum.
            <br><br>
            The lorem ipsum is based on De finibus bonorum et malorum, a Latin text written by Cicero in 45 BC.
            Typographers and printers have used passages from this work for formatting since the 16th century. Many
            words have been added or modified over the centuries. As a result, the lorem ipsum is no longer considered
            Latin, even though it looks a lot like it.
            <br><br>
            The lorem ipsum gets its name from the Latin phrase Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor
            sit amet. which translates to “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
            because it is pain.”
            <br><br>
            <b>English Translated:</b>
            <br><br>
            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born
            and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
            of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful.
            <br><br>
            Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
            occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
            trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage
            from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
            consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
            and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
            <br><br>
            In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
            we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
            owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to
            be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
            principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
            avoid worse pains.
